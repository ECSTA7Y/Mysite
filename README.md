# A Hugo Theme Based on Lithium

I modified [lithium](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-lithium-theme/) theme, in short, I changed CSS colors and fonts. I use a darker background color to protect programmers' eyes. Default articles list has been deleted.


This theme has been use on my personal website:<https://xsong.ltd/>

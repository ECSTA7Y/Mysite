## 作文

### [并列连词](http://www.en998.com/g/biaodian/020160408.html)

1. 如果并列的是两个句子，即并列句，则and 前经常加[逗号](http://www.pinlue.com/article/2018/09/1612/547220023914.html)

  + People will not buy as many cars as before,<font color=#FF0000> and </font> they can even use old cars.

  + In first place, as the world's natural environment becomes worse,<font color=#FF0000> and </font>  it is compelling and emergent to preserve our global environment.
  
  + All those kinds of transportation are healthier than cars,<font color=#FF0000> and </font> people will gradually give up driving cars.

### 不要使用并列连词开始一个句子

+ ~~<font color=#FF0000>So</font> it should be worried that the remaining wilderness areas will not be admonished.~~

## 定语从句指代混淆的问题

Furthermore, the awareness of protecting the environment is increasing more and more,<font color=#FF0000> which</font> means cars will gradually be less and less used as main transportation.

最好改为：

Furthermore, the awareness of protecting the environment is increasing more and more, meaning cars will gradually be fewer.

### 新句子最好别用代词

+ However,<font color=#FF0000> it </font> was enlarged by others and the wood used was from the same tree of another painting of Rembrandt

改为：

+ However,<font color=#FF0000> the painting</font>  was enlarged by others and the wood used was from the same tree of another painting of Rembrandt

## 作文

### [并列连词](http://www.en998.com/g/biaodian/020160408.html)

1. 如果并列的是两个句子，即并列句，则and 前经常加[逗号](http://www.pinlue.com/article/2018/09/1612/547220023914.html)

  + People will not buy as many cars as before,<font color=#FF0000> and </font> they can even use old cars.

  + In first place, as the world's natural environment becomes worse,<font color=#FF0000> and </font>  it is compelling and emergent to preserve our global environment.
  
  + All those kinds of transportation are healthier than cars,<font color=#FF0000> and </font> people will gradually give up driving cars.

### 不要使用并列连词开始一个句子

最好改为：

My name is Xiao Song. I am a junior student from  [East China Normal University](http://english.ecnu.edu.cn/) (ECNU). During my study at ECNU, I have mastered advanced statistical analysis and programming skills and am able to apply these skills in solving real world problems. In addition, I had solid research projects utilizing econometric knowledge. I can independently complete an integral data analysis report using statistical software such as Python and R. As hobbies, I love listening Rock and hip-hop music.

You can find my CV attached [here](/en/enresume/).
